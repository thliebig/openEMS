	// openEMS has different modules, and some options may be relevant
	// only to a single module, such as the upcoming Tiling engine.
	// Putting all getters and setters into the main openEMS class would
	// decreases modularity. It's the best if each module can handle their
	// own options. On the other hand, we really need to know all the options
	// globally to (1) check whether an option is valid, and (2) provide a
	// single API to set runtime options when running as a shared library
	// for Python binding.
	//
	// Thus, we use the following 3-step process.
	//
	// 1. If a class accepts options, it provides a method optionDesc()
	// that returns a options_description. During early initialization,
	// the main program openems.cpp collects them from multiple classes,
	// then registers them at here by calling appendOptionDesc(). Callback
	// functions can also be registered via options_description, which
	// may be used to set the internal state of a class.
	//
	// 2. Before starting simulation, if we're running as an executable,
	// parseCommandLineArguments() is called. If we're running as a shared
	// library, parseOption() is called (by the user). Callback functions
	// are also executed at this moment.
	//
	// 3. The parsed options is stored as a variables_map in m_options, which
	// can be accessed globally. Each module only needs to care about its
	// own options. If a class is only newed after parsing all options
	// (such as an engine-specific option), callbacks can't be used so the
	// getOption() method is used instead.

	// Return a list of supported options. If a class accepts options,
	// it should have its own method.
	boost::program_options::options_description optionDesc();

	// The optionDesc() of all classes are collected by openems.cpp by
	// calling appendOptionDesc.
	void appendOptionDesc(boost::program_options::options_description desc);

	// If multiple openEMS() instances are created within the application, two
	// problem occurs. First, identical optionDesc are registered to Global()
	// more than once creating command-line option conflict everywhere. This
	// problem can't be prevented by registering only once - re-registering is
	// needed because callback functions are specific to a particular openEMS()
	// instance, so all argument changes would only be applied to the first one.
	// Thus, we always call clearOptionDesc() just before we start parsing
	// arguments in collectCommandLineArguments(), so that the callback handlers
	// are always installed to the current openEMS() instance.
	//
	// FIXME: This is only a workaround. Global() options are still fundamentally
	// thread-unsafe (in rare cases, one openEMS instance may change the global
	// options within one thread, while the other openEMS instance is still trying
	// to read their values). In the future, rewrite Global() to make it a
	// per-openEMS instance or per-thread entity.
	void clearOptionDesc();

	// Parse all options provided as a std::vector of std::strings,
	// used when running as a shared library. May throw.
	void parseLibraryArguments(std::vector<std::string> allOptions);
